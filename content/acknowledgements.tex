\section*{Acknowledgments}\label{chapter:acknowledgments}
I would like to sincerely thank everybody that helped me write this thesis. In particular, I would like to thank Erik Poll. His guidance and thoughtful questions about my approach made me think deeper about the research. It was a joy and great learning experience to work with him. Multiple people have provided feedback and guidance throughout the research and proofread the thesis. My wholehearted thanks to you all. This thesis has become much better because all of you.
