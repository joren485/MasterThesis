\section{Comparison With Capa}\label{section:capa comparison experiments}
In \autoref{section:real-world experiments}, we showed that CSP is capable of finding persistence techniques. In this section, we will compare CSP to Capa, to get an idea of how well CSP performs compared to existing tooling. As both Capa and CSP are static analysis tools that search for specific elements in a binary based on pre-defined conditions, the tools are easy to compare.

It is important to note that we are making this comparison to determine the effectiveness of Call Signatures and CSP, and not to showcase a replacement for Capa.
