\section{Scheduled Task-based Persistence Techniques}\label{section:scheduled task-based persistence}
Scheduled Tasks are a way to run applications at pre-defined events or times in Windows (discussed in \autoref{section:scheduled tasks services in windows}). Like services, malware can use them for persistence.

\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{TP\arabic*}:}, ref=TP\arabic*, start=0]
    \item \label{TP0} Malware can create a scheduled task that runs on boot or a schedule (e.g. every hour) to ensure persistence. As this task can run as the \texttt{LocalSystem} account, this would immediately give the malware full administrative privileges.

    \begin{itemize}[label={}, leftmargin=*]
        \item \textbf{Runs as}: Scheduled Tasks can run as a specific user, \texttt{LocalService}, \texttt{NetworkService}, or \texttt{LocalSystem}. See \autoref{section:scheduled tasks services in windows} for more detailed information on these accounts.

        \item \textbf{Administrator rights required}: Yes

        \item \textbf{ATT\&CK ID}: T1053.005
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
