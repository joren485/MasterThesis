\chapter{Background on x86 \& Windows}\label{chapter:background x86 windows}
We will first go over the necessary background information. In \autoref{section:background x86}, we give general information on the CPU architecture that is used by Windows, x86. As this provides information on general concepts (registers, memory management, and assembly), it can be skipped by people that are familiar with these subjects. After that, we will discuss function calls and how they work in assembly, in \autoref{section:function calls}. Finally, we will discuss Windows. As Windows is a large, complex platform and operating system, we will focus on concepts that are used in this thesis: the Windows API, the Windows Registry, Windows Services, and Scheduled Tasks.

In the next chapter we will discuss malware (\autoref{chapter:background malware}).
